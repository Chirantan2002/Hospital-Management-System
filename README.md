# Hospital Management App

CareSync is a full-stack hospital management platform with separate backend API, patient-facing frontend, and admin/doctor management portals. The platform is designed to streamline the complete healthcare workflow for patients, doctors, and administrators. The system provides a centralized solution for appointment scheduling, doctor management, medical service discovery, secure authentication, image management, and online payment processing.

## ⚙️ Setup Guide

Each subproject installs and runs independently.

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create `backend/.env` with:

```env
MONGODB_URI=                  YOUR_MONGODB_URI
JWT_SECRET=                   YOUR_JWT_SECRET
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=        YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=           YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=        YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=            YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
FRONTEND_URL=                 YOUR_FRONTEND_URL
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=        YOUR_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=             YOUR_CLERK_SECRET_KEY
```

Start the backend:

```bash
npm start
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create `frontend/.env` with:

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=   YOUR_VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
```

Run the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Admin Setup

```bash
cd admin
npm install
```

Create `admin/.env` with:

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=   YOUR_VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

## 💡 Deployment Notes

- The backend CORS policy is limited to approved origins in `backend/server.js`
- Stripe payment confirmation depends on valid `FRONTEND_URL`
- Cloudinary stores uploaded images; replacing or deleting records removes old images where possible
- Clerk secures the frontend and admin routes, while doctor admin routes use JWT auth

---

## ✅ Notes

- Dependencies are managed inside each subfolder (`backend`, `frontend`, `admin`)
- Do not commit real secrets or `.env` files to source control
- `backend` is the central API for both React clients
